# Todo App

A simple and modern Todo application built with React and styled using Tailwind CSS. This app allows users to add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as complete, with data persistence using local storage.

## Features
- Add new tasks with a single click.
- Edit existing tasks inline.
- Delete tasks you no longer need.
- Toggle tasks as complete/incomplete with a checkbox.
- Data persists in the browser's local storage, so tasks remain after a page refresh.

## Tech Stack

- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling the app with a modern, responsive design.
- **React Context API**: For state management across components.
- **Local Storage**: For persisting tasks in the browser.
